        <div class="subheading mb-5">Criminal LaywerðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I began working as a helper for my dad since he wpuld take me on jobs. I started off doing the most simple tasks he would normally have to do. As time went on, I began learning to do more and more things. I strated off only being allowed to remove light switch plates and helping prepare rooms before painting. Now I prepare the job site, paint everything, and focus on small details that will make it stand out. With over 12 years of experience, I am a few tasks away from being able to find painting jobs on my own. <br></br>

        Once I began college courses, I decided to get a more managable job that was more flexible with my school schedule. I was recommended by a friend and was given a job at McDonalds. Before my first official week of starting work, I was called in by the store manager on Thanksgiving. Given the circumstances, I was eager to work and wanted to make a good impression so I went in. After that, the manager saw that I was a quick learner and was dependable, so by that time next month, I was clocking in more hours than most of the workers there. Four months later, I found out that same manager was going to be relocated to a different location. Before leaving however, he was recommending me to move up to a lower level management position while still not even having a full year of experience.<br></br>

        Now I am branching out trying to find new opportunities. I recntly got into videography and enjoy learning how to use editing software. I started with Davinci Resolve since it was free, but have just switched to Premiere Pro. I realized  early on, I would have to invest in order better the quality of my work. I invested in a new camera, lighting equipment, and a stabilizer. However, just having new things doesn't mean it will be better. From then, to even now, I am learning how to do more and more things while both doing on location shooting and post work editing. Although it is not my passion, I enjoy learning new skills and i believe it is important to know how to do many things, even if you might not use them later on in life. <br></br>
        
        It wasn't until senior year in high school that I found an interest in law. My high school AP Government teacher was a lawyer before pursued a career in teaching. However, every time he would talk about his past career, i would always find myself wanting to know more. From there, I got an idea of what career I wanted to follow.
